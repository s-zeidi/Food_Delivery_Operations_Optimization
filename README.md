# Food_Delivery_Operations_Optimization

## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing food delivery operations using various business process modeling and machine learning techniques. It utilizes **BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation)** for modeling the entire food delivery process, from customer ordering to restaurant fulfillment, delivery coordination, and customer feedback. The aim is to enhance efficiency, optimize operations, and improve customer satisfaction.

## Key Features
- **BPMN Modeling**: Visual representation of the food delivery process, including:
  - Customer Ordering
  - Restaurant Fulfillment
  - Delivery Coordination
  - Customer Receipt and Feedback
- **Critical Success Factors (CSF)**, **Key Goal Indicators (KGI)**, and **Key Performance Indicators (KPI)** are applied to measure and optimize performance across the system.
- **Cycle Time Analysis**: Calculated for various subprocesses such as order processing, food preparation, and delivery.
  
## Machine Learning Techniques
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts delivery times based on factors such as distance, order complexity, and traffic.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Forecasts customer demand across different areas, helping optimize driver allocation and inventory management.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segments customers based on order history, preferences, and behaviors, enabling personalized promotions and better marketing strategies.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `sklearn`
  - `tensorflow` (for LSTM)
  - `matplotlib` (for visualizations)
  - `bpmn-python` (for BPMN modeling)




3. Load the BPMN models and run the data analysis scripts as needed.

## Usage
- Model the food delivery process using **BPMN** to visually identify inefficiencies.
- Use **Linear Regression**, **LSTM**, and **K-Means** for predictive and optimization tasks.
- Analyze the cycle time of different operations and adjust based on findings.
